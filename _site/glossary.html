<div class="whatis">
<p class="headline">Why is Slow Money important?</p>
<p>There are many local food producers, food chain contributors and consumers who believe in sustainable food production, such as organic farming and free range livestock. Sustainable production typically provides for returns on investment based on different criteria than industrial "factory farm" production methods. Because of this, sustainable food businesses have difficulty finding investment capital to expand their operations, even when high demand extists for their products. An objective of Slow Money is to find local investors whose values and expectations align with the "slow food" concept and who are willing to investment in their community.</p>
